## Provision Yourself a Local Environment

1. After you've cloned this repository into a convenient directory, go ahead and run an ```nom install``` to grab the dependencies for the project. you might have to run ```sudo npm install``` if your user's permissions aren't quite right.

2. Run the development server by typing ```make``` in the root of this repository. Then point your browser at ```http://localhost:8000.``` All front-end development should be located in the ```/source``` folder - it's our equivalent of public_html!
